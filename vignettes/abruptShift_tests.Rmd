This notebook implements a test of the `actR::detectShiftCore()` function on synthetic data (see data_raw/makeSyntheticData.R for their construction). 

The idea is to evaluate the proportion of false negatives and false positives and construct receiver operating characteristic curves and their sensitivity to:
- abruptness (the time over which the shift occurs, from 0 to T/2, where T is the length of the series)
- noise levels. 
- age uncertainties.

```{r Load test data }
lngth <- 400
time <- 1.0*seq(lngth)
vals <- pseudoShifts$paleoData_values[[1]]  
res <- detectShiftCore(time = time,vals = vals)
propagateUncertainty(time = time,vals = vals, changeFun = detectShiftCore)
```

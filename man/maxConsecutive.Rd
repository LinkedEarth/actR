\item{vec}{a vector}

\item{val}{the value to search for consecutive values}

\item{gte}{return indices for values greater than or equal to this number of consecutive values (default= NA, which is only the max). Note that if gte > the max, the index returned will be NA}
}
\value{
the number of consecutive values. 0 means that value is not present in the vector
}
